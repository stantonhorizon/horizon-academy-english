# Roadmap

![Horizon Protocol Roadmap Update - April 1, 2022](../../.gitbook/assets/horizon\_protocol\_roadmap\_220401.png)

## Ongoing

* UI/UX Upgrades
* Adding new zAssets

These are items that essentially never end. zAssets will keep getting added on Horizon Exchange. The user-interface and user-experience will continuously improve depending on the feedback we get from our community.

## Coming Up in Q2 2022

* Horizon Exchange — Mainnet
* Horizon Genesis 2.0 — Testnet / Mainnet
* Horizon Dashboard 1.5 — Testnet / Mainnet
* Horizon Academy Beta
* Chainlink Keeper integration

Besides the ongoing tasks, these are the items that we’re currently focused on getting delivered in Q2. Below we will briefly explain each item.

## Horizon Exchange

Needless to say, this has our highest priority. It’s been long-awaited, the community has been eager to see it in action, with testnet we offered you some hands-on experience, and your feedback showed us how highly the community thinks of it.

## Horizon Genesis v2.0

We will be providing needed updates to Horizon Genesis and will be launching a brand new version that includes improved UX and new features such as debt tracking analytics, escrow rewards tracking and many more. Stay tuned for a future update about Horizon Genesis 2.0.

## Horizon Dashboard v1.5

We will be introducing new trackable metrics for Horizon Exchange and updates to UI for the same reason as above; provide the necessary data to HZN stakers and traders. We will also be releasing a future update about Horizon Dashboard 1.5.

## Horizon Academy Beta <a href="#1976" id="1976"></a>

As our products expand, so will our docs. Our current [docs](https://docs.horizonprotocol.com/) won’t be able to host everything that we have planned, while keeping them comprehensible for the reader. This is why we want to introduce Horizon Academy. Horizon Academy is a knowledge base for all things related to Horizon Protocol. Definitions, explanations, tutorials, FAQs, will all be added and linked to Horizon Academy for easy access.

## In the Pipeline

* Collateralized zAsset Shorting
* zBaskets (Market Index zAssets)
* Trading Competitions / Social Trading
* Add new zAsset collateral options/wrappers
* Integrate Chainlink Keepers
* Bridge to ETH and incentivize staking pools on Uniswap
* Horizon Governance (HIPs) 1.0
* Perpetual Futures Trading 1.0
* Options Trading 1.0
* … many more!

These are items that are planned to be added to Horizon Protocol after we complete our current objectives. As time goes on, these items will be moved into our active quarter goals when we get there. These items are in no particular order, so we are eager to hear what excites you guys the most or if there are items that are not on the list that should be, please let us know!

## Completed

* Horizon Exchange 1.0 Testnet
* Horizon Genesis 1.0 Mainnet
* Horizon Genesis 1.0 Testnet
* Horizon Staker + 3 Pools
* PancakeSwap IFO
* Horizon Protocol Smart Contract Deployment Mainnet
* Litepaper

This shows everything that has been completed thus far. Expect this to become a whole lot more!
