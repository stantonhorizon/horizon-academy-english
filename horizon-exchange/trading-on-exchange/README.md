## **Markets** <a href="#id-2cb6" id="id-2cb6"></a>

The ‘Markets’ tab is an overview of the synthetic asset (zAsset) market available on Horizon Exchange. You can see market highlights: top gainer (24h), top loser (24h), highest volume (24h), and the largest zAsset. And, check out different zAssets in various categories.

Select the market you want to trade in!

## **Trade** <a href="#id-32e2" id="id-32e2"></a>

The ‘Trade’ tab is where you can buy and sell zAssets! Try selecting the zAsset you wish to trade, we’ll use zDOGE for this guide. You can use the TradingView chart to help you make a decision.

You can enter an amount to **buy** in zUSD, zDOGE, or use the slider to select a percentage amount.

You can similarly **sell** a zAsset by selecting ‘SELL zXXX’.

Your buy or sell trade will go into ‘**Pending**’ status whilst the transaction is sent to the blockchain.

‘**Oracle Check**’ status when your transaction has succeeded and is in the 3 minute oracle front running prevention period. Learn more about oracle front running [here](exchange-fees.md#fbee).
