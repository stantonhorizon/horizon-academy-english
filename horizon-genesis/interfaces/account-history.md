# Account - History

Account History keeps track of all previous staking-related transactions.

This includes all "Mint", "Burn", and "Claim" actions.

This does not include Trade or Earn actions.

### **Interface**

The History Tab interface includes the following:

* **Type** The type of staking action that occurred. Each action here is written into the blockchain and would have required a transaction on BNB Chain.
* **Date (UTC)** Date and time at which this occurred. Note that this will be UTC time.
* **Amount** The amount of HZN and zUSD that was "Minted", "Burned", or "Claimed".
* **Tx** The "View" link will take you to the transaction on Bscscan.com.
